# Java Docker Day 2 Exercise

## Learning Objectives

- Create a Spring Application with the usual end points
- Practice deploying the Spring Application to a Docker Container
- Use a separate container to host a PostgreSQL database
- Use docker-compose to orchestrate creating and running your containers

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your machine
3. Open the project in IntelliJ

## Core

Create an API with the usual GET/PUT/POST/DELETE endpoints. 

The API should serve user data for a Micro-Blogging platform (something like Twitter).

Work out some sensible tables for a basic version of this that will allow a single user to use the platform to make posts etc. 

Your API should connect to PostgreSQL database instance that will run in a local container.

Create a `jar` file for the completed application.

Use `docker-compose` to create the appropriate images and orchestrate running them together, it should also manage the connection details for the database.

To assess this we will clone your repository, and use your `docker-compose.yml` file to generate the appropriate images and run them.

## Extension

In addition to the basic single user Micro-Blogging platform add the ability for it to have multiple users, who can interact with each other's posts (friend lists, upvotes, reposting etc).
